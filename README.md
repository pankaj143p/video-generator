This project is a video generation tool built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The app allows users to generate AI-powered videos through an API.

## Features

- **AI-based Video Generation**: Automatically generates video content based on user input.
- **API Integration**: Uses various APIs for processing and rendering video content.
- **Fast and Scalable**: Deployed on Vercel with serverless architecture for fast response times and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for building the web application.
- **Vercel**: Hosting platform for the deployment of the application.
- **Prisma**: ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for database management.
- **Replicate API**: AI API used for generating video content.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for better development experience.
